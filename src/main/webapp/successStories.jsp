                Karen's fear of public speaking began after a panic attack during an orchestra audition at age 12. She spent years avoiding public situations, pursuing a career in IT. However, after taking the Fear-less course, she realized her fear was exaggerated in her own mind. Today, Karen confidently addresses classrooms as a primary school teacher.
